_The following form is designed to provide information for your tool that should be included in the effort to verify the Rust standard library. Please note that the tool will need to be **supported** if it is to be included._

## Tool Name
**KMIR**

## Description
_KMIR is a formal verification tool for Rust that defines the operational semantics of Rust’s Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR) in K. By leveraging the K framework, KMIR provides a parser, interpreter, and symbolic execution engine for MIR programs. This tool enables direct execution and step-by-step inspection of MIR, serving as a foundational step toward full formal verification of Rust programs. KMIR allows developers to extract MIR from Rust’s compilation process, execute it, and eventually prove critical properties of their code. It is available via our package manager, kup, making it easily installable and integrable into various workflows._

## Tool Information

- [x] **Does the tool perform Rust verification?**  
  *Yes – It performs verification at the MIR level, which is a critical intermediate representation of Rust programs.*

- [x] **Does the tool deal with *unsafe* Rust code?**  
  *Yes – By operating on MIR, KMIR can analyze both safe and unsafe Rust code.*

- [x] **Does the tool run independently in CI?**  
  *Yes – KMIR can be integrated into CI workflows via our package manager and Nix-based build system.*

- [x] **Is the tool open source?**  
  *Yes – KMIR is open source and available on GitHub.*

- [x] **Is the tool under development?**  
  *Yes – KMIR is actively under development, with ongoing improvements to MIR syntax coverage and verification capabilities.*

- [x] **Will you or your team be able to provide support for the tool?**  
  *Yes – The Runtime Verification team is committed to supporting KMIR and will provide ongoing maintenance and community support.*


## Comparison to Other Approved Tools
_KMIR distinguishes itself by focusing on the formal operational semantics of Rust’s MIR using the K framework. Unlike other verification tools that operate at higher abstraction levels or require learning new specification languages, KMIR enables developers to work directly with the MIR generated by `rustc`. This approach offers:
- **Direct Inspection:** Execute and inspect MIR programs in a human-readable format.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easy integration with existing Rust toolchains via kup and Nix.
- **Symbolic Execution:** A built-in symbolic execution engine that paves the way for future full formal verification.
- **Flexibility:** Support for both safe and unsafe Rust code without requiring developers to switch contexts._

## Licenses
_KMIR is released under an OSI-approved open source license. It is distributed under the BSD-3 clause license, which is compatible with the Rust standard library licenses. Please refer to the KMIR GitHub repository for full license details._

## Artifacts & Audit Mechanisms
_If there are noteworthy examples of using the tool to perform verification, please include them in this section. Links, papers, etc._
_Also include mechanisms for the committee to audit the implementation and correctness of this tool (e.g., regression tests)._

## Versioning
_Please describe how you version the tool._

## CI
_If your tool is approved, you will be responsible merging a workflow into this repository that runs your tool against the standard library. For an example, see the Kani workflow (.github/workflows/kani.yml). Describe, at a high level, how your workflow will operate. (E.g., how will you package the tool to run in CI, how will you identify which proofs to run?)._
