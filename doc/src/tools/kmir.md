## Tool Name
**KMIR**

## Description

[KMIR](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics) is a formal
verification tool for Rust that defines the operational semantics of Rust’s
Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR) in K (through Stable MIR). By
leveraging the [K framework](https://kframework.org/), KMIR provides a parser,
interpreter, and symbolic execution engine for MIR programs. This tool enables
direct execution of concrete and symbolic input, with step-by-step inspection of
the internal state of the MIR program's execution, serving as a foundational
step toward full formal verification of Rust programs. Through the dependency
[Stable MIR JSON](https://github.com/runtimeverification/stable-mir-json/), KMIR
allows developers to extract serialized Stable MIR from Rust’s compilation
process, execute it, and eventually prove critical properties of their
code.

This diagram describes the extraction and verification workflow for KMIR:

The [K Framework](https://kframework.org/) is the basis of how
KMIR operates to guarantee properties of Rust programs. K is a rewrite-based
semantic framework based on [matching logic](http://www.matching-logic.org/) in
which programming languages, their operational semantics and type systems, and
formal analysis tools can be defined through syntax, configurations, and rules.
The _syntax_ definitions in KMIR model the AST of Stable MIR (e.g., the
statements and terminator of a basic block in a function body) and configuration
data that exists at runtime (e.g., the stack frame structure of a function
call).
The _configuration_ of a KMIR program organizes the state of an executed program in
nested configuration units called cells (e.g., a stack frame is part of a stack
stored in the configuration).
_K Framework transition rules_ of the KMIR semantics are rewriting steps that
match patterns and transform the current continuation and state accordingly.
They describe how program configuration and its contained data changes when
particular program statements or terminators are executed (e.g., a returning
function modifies the call stack and writes a return value into the caller's
local variables).

Using the K semantics of Stable MIR, the KMIR execution of an entire Rust
program represented as Stable MIR breaks down to a series of configuration
rewrites that compute data held in local variables, and the program may either
terminate normally or reach an exception or construct with undefined behaviour,
which terminates the execution abnormally. KMIR is designed to provide sound 
assurances about undefined behavior (UB) in Rust’s MIR. Rather than statically 
over‑approximating or flagging UB at every unsafe block, KMIR models the full 
MIR semantics, including UB transitions, using a **refusal-to-execute** strategy.
This means that if symbolic execution reaches a MIR instruction and cannot prove 
that executing it would not result in UB (e.g., an out-of-bounds pointer dereference 
or an unchecked arithmetic overflow), execution halts in a `UB DETECTED` state. 
This state cannot be unified with a valid target state in the proof, so the proof 
fails. KMIR systematically explores all feasible paths under the user-supplied 
preconditions. Only when **every** path terminates without hitting UB *and* 
satisfies the target property does KMIR declare the program UB-free (and correct 
for the property). Additionally, the `--terminate-on-thunk` flag (recommended for all proofs)
ensures that if the symbolic execution reaches a MIR construct whose semantics
are not yet implemented, the proof halts cleanly rather than silently passing
through unsupported operations. This ensures that any “no UB” claim holds under
the sole assumption that KMIR’s implementation of the supported MIR fragment is
correct. 

Programs modelled in K Framework can be executed _symbolically_, i.e., operating 
on abstract input which is not fully specified but characterized by _path conditions_ 
(e.g., that an integer variable holds an unknown but non-negative value).

K (and thus KMIR) verifies program correctness by performing an
_all-path-reachability proof_ using the symbolic execution engine and verifier
derived from the K encoding of the Stable MIR operational semantics.
The K semantics framework is based on reachability logic, which is a theory
describing transition systems in [matching logic](http://www.matching-logic.org/).
An all-path-reachability proof in this system verifies that a particular
_target_ end state is _always_ reached from a given starting state.
The rewrite rules branch on symbolic inputs covering the possible transitions,
creating a model that is provably complete. For all-path reachability, every
leaf state is required to unify with the target state.
A one-path-reachability proof is similar to the above, but the proof requirement
is that _at least one_ leaf state unifies with the target state.

When performing a proof of a program that involves recursion or a loop construct,
one of several possible techniques can be used:

1) K (and thus KMIR) are capable of unbounded verification via allowing the
   user to write loop invariants. However, these loop invariants would then
   need to be written in K's native language.
2) As potential future work, it would be possible to implement an annotation
   language to provide the required context for loop invariant directly in
   source code (as done in the past using natspec for Solidity code).
3) In general, K also supports bounded loop unrolling, by way of identifying
   loop heads and counting how many times the same loop head has been observed.
   This technique is managed by the all-path reachability prover library for
   K and works out of the box with suitable arguments, without requiring any
   special support from the back-end.

Our front-end, at the time of writing, does not have either of these
options turned on. When a proof involves an unbounded loop or recursion
without an invariant, the symbolic execution continues exploring paths
until a configurable bound is reached (via `--max-depth` or
`--max-iterations`). If the bound is exceeded before all paths are
fully explored, the proof does **not** pass — it results in stuck or
pending nodes in the control flow graph, which KMIR reports as a
non-passing proof. This means KMIR will never silently claim
correctness for programs with unbounded behavior that it cannot fully
explore. As soon as larger programs will require it, we will offer
user-supplied K-level loop invariants and/or bounded loop unrolling
support.

### Known Limitations

KMIR is under active development. The following limitations apply to
the current version:

- **MIR construct coverage:** KMIR supports a substantial subset of
  Stable MIR including integer and float arithmetic, structs, enums
  (including niche-encoded variants), arrays, closures, unions,
  transmute casts, pointer offsets, global and heap allocations,
  volatile load/store, and function pointers. Constructs **not yet
  supported** include: async/await, trait objects (`dyn`), iterators,
  `Vec`/`String`/`HashMap`, `Box`/`Rc`/`Arc` (smart pointers),
  multi-threading, panic unwinding, and `Drop` destructors.
- **Thunk mechanism for unsupported constructs:** When KMIR encounters
  an operation whose semantics are not yet implemented, it produces a
  _thunk_ — a placeholder that marks the unsupported operation. With
  `--terminate-on-thunk` (recommended for all proofs), the proof halts
  at this point, ensuring unsupported operations are never silently
  skipped. Without this flag, the thunk propagates through the proof
  state and the proof will typically not pass because the thunk cannot
  unify with a valid target state.
- **Loop invariants:** User-supplied loop invariants are supported in
  principle via K's native language but are not yet exposed through a
  Rust-level annotation language. Programs with unbounded loops require
  manual K-level invariant specification or bounded exploration.
- **Invalid loop invariants:** If a user provides a K-level invariant
  that is not actually inductive, the prover will detect this: the
  proof step that attempts to apply the invariant will fail to
  discharge its side conditions, resulting in a stuck proof node. The
  proof will not pass.

For the most up-to-date list of supported features and known issues,
see the [mir-semantics issue
tracker](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics/issues).

KMIR also prioritizes UI with interactive proof exploration available
out-of-the-box through the terminal KCFG (K Control Flow Graph) viewer, allowing
users to inspect intermediate states of the proof to get feedback on the
successful path conditions and failing at unifying with the target state. An
example of a KMIR proof being analyzed using the KCFG viewer can be seen below:

## Comparison to Other Approved Tools
The other tools approved at the time of writing are Kani, Verifast, and
Goto-transcoder (ESBMC).

- **Verification Backend:** KMIR primarily differs from all of these tools by
  utilizing a unique verification backend through the K framework and
  reachability logic (as explained in the description above). KMIR has little
  dependence on an SAT solver or SMT solver. Kani's CBMC backend and
  Goto-transcoder (ESBMC) encode the verification problem into an SAT / SMT
  verification condition to be discharged by the appropriate solver. Kani
  recently added a Lean backend through Aeneas, however Lean does not support
  matching or reachability logic currently. Verifast performs symbollic
  execution of the verification target like KMIR, however reasoning is performed
  by annotating functions with design-by-contract components in separation
  logic.
- **Verification Input:** KMIR takes input from Stable MIR JSON, an effort to
  serialize the internal MIR in a portable way that can be reusable by other
  projects.
- **K Ecosystem:** Since all tools in the K ecosystem share a common foundation
  of K, all projects benefit from development done by other K projects. This
  means that performance and user experience are projected to improve due to the
  continued development of other semantics.

## Steps to Use the Tool

The [KMIR docker
image](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics/blob/c221c81d73a56c48692a087a2ced29917de99246/Dockerfile.kmir)
is currently the best option for casual users of KMIR. It contains an
installation of K Framework, the tool `kmir`, and the `stable-mir-json`
extraction tool, which is a custom version of `rustc` which extracts Stable MIR
as JSON or as graphviz' *.dot when compiling a crate.
The image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/runtimeverificationinc/kmir/tags).

Alternatively, the tools for `kmir` can be built from source as [described in
the `mir-semantics` repository's
`README.md`](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics). This
requires an installation of `K Framework`, best done [using the `kup`
tool](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup/README.md), and includes a
git submodule dependency on `stable-mir-json`.

The `stable-mir-json` tool is a custom driver for `rustc` which, while compiling
Rust code, writes the code's Stable MIR, represented in a JSON format, to a
file.  Just like `rustc` itself, `stable-mir-json` extracts MIR of a single
crate and must be invoked via `cargo` for multi-crate programs. Besides the JSON
extraction, `stable-mir-json` can also write a graphviz `dot` file representing
the Stable MIR structure of all functions and their call graph within the crate.

The `kmir` tool provides commands to work with the Stable MIR representation of
Rust programs that `stable-mir-json` extracts.

* Run Stable MIR code extracted from Rust programs (`kmir run my-program.smir.json`);
* Prove that a given Rust program or function will terminate without panics or
  undefined behaviour (`kmir prove my-program.rs [--start-symbol my_function]`;
  also available as `kmir prove-rs` for backward compatibility).
  This command invokes `stable-mir-json` internally, and then performs an all-path
  reachability proof that the program reaches normal termination under all possible
  inputs. Any statements that would panic or cause undefined behaviour will terminate
  execution so this proves the successful execution. Pre- and post-conditions can be
  modelled using assertions and conditional execution. The `--terminate-on-thunk`
  flag is recommended to ensure soundness (see Known Limitations above).
* (Advanced use for K experts:) Prove a property about a Rust program, which is
  given as a K "claim" and proven using an all-path reachability proof in K
  (`kmir prove my-program-spec.k --smir`);
* Print or inspect the control flow graph of a program's proof constructed by the
  `kmir prove` command (`kmir show module.proof_identifier`
  and `kmir view module.proof_identifier`);

An example of proofs using KMIR, and how to construct them in Rust code,
are [provided in the `kmir-proofs`
directory](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std/tree/main/kmir-proofs).

The `kmir` tool is under active development at the time of writing.
Future development will include using source code annotations instead of explicit
test functions to better integrate with Rust code bases, using a suitable annotation
language to express pre- and post-conditions.

## Artifacts & Audit Mechanisms

- The [mir-semantics repository](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics)
  includes a comprehensive regression test suite that is run on every PR via CI.
  This test suite covers MIR construct parsing, concrete execution, and symbolic
  proof scenarios, ensuring the correctness of the KMIR semantics implementation.
- Example proofs demonstrating KMIR's verification capabilities on Rust standard
  library functions are provided in the
  [`kmir-proofs`](https://github.com/model-checking/verify-rust-std/tree/main/kmir-proofs)
  directory of this repository.
- The K Framework itself has been used to formally verify production systems
  including the [KEVM Ethereum virtual machine
  semantics](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics) and various
  smart contract languages, providing a track record of formal verification at
  scale.

## Versioning

KMIR follows a sequential version numbering scheme. Releases are published as
Docker images on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/runtimeverificationinc/kmir/tags) with tags in the
format `ubuntu-jammy-{version}` (e.g., `ubuntu-jammy-0.4.202`). The version
number is incremented with each release and corresponds to the state of the
[mir-semantics repository](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics)
at the time of release. Version updates to the CI workflow in this repository are
managed by the Runtime Verification team, coordinated with updates to the proof
examples to ensure continued compatibility.

## CI Integration

The KMIR CI workflow (`.github/workflows/kmir.yml`) runs KMIR proofs on every
pull request and push to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Runs a Docker container using the pinned KMIR image from Docker Hub.
3. Executes the proof runner script (`kmir-proofs/unchecked_arithmetic/run-proofs.sh`),
   which iterates over annotated proof targets in the Rust source files and
   invokes `kmir prove` with `--terminate-on-thunk` for each target.
4. Each proof must pass (all paths reach normal termination without UB) for the
   CI check to succeed.

The Docker-based approach ensures reproducibility across environments and avoids
the need to install the K Framework toolchain in CI.
