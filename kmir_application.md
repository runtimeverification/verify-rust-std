## Tool Name
**KMIR**

## Description
[KMIR](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics) is a formal verification tool for Rust that defines the operational semantics of Rust’s Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR) in K (through Stable MIR). By leveraging the [K framework](https://kframework.org/), KMIR provides a parser, interpreter, and symbolic execution engine for MIR programs. This tool enables direct execution of concrete and symbolic input, with step-by-step inspection of the internal state of the MIR program's execution, serving as a foundational step toward full formal verification of Rust programs. Through the dependency [Stable MIR JSON](https://github.com/runtimeverification/stable-mir-json/), KMIR allows developers to extract serialized Stable MIR from Rust’s compilation process, execute it, and eventually prove critical properties of their code. Soon, KMIR will be available via our package manager, [kup](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup), which will make it easily installable and integrable into various workflows.

This diagram describes the extraction and verification workflow for KMIR:

Particular to this challenge, KMIR verifies program correctness using the correct-by-construction symbolic execution engine and verifier derived from the K encoding of the Stable MIR semantics. The K semantics framework is based on reachability logic, which is a theory describing transition systems in [matching logic](http://www.matching-logic.org/). Transition rules of the semantics are rewriting steps that match patterns and transform the current continuation and state accordingly. An all-path-reachability proof in this system verifies that a particular _target_ end state is _always_ reachable from a given starting state. The rewrite rules branch on symbolic inputs covering the possible transitions, creating a model that is provably complete, and requiring unification on every leaf state. A one-path-reachability proof is similar to the above, but the proof requirement is that at least one leaf state unifies with the target state. One feature of such a system is that the requirement for an SMT is minimized to determining completeness on path conditions when branching would occur.

KMIR also prioritizes UI with interactive proof exploration available out-of-the-box through the terminal KCFG (K Control Flow Graph) viewer, allowing users to inspect intermediate states of the proof to get feedback on the successful path conditions and failing at unifying with the target state. An example of a KMIR proof being analyzed using the KCFG viewer can be seen below:

## Comparison to Other Approved Tools
The other tools approved at the time of writing at Kani, Verifast, and Goto-transcoder (ESBMC).

- **Verification Backend:** KMIR primarily differs from all of these tools by utilizing a unique verification backend through the K framework and reachability logic (as explained in the description above). KMIR has little dependence on an SAT solver or SMT solver. Kani's CBMC backend and Goto-transcode (ESBMC) encode the verification problem into an SAT / SMT verification condition to be discharged by the appropriate solver. Kani recently added a Lean backend through Aeneas, however Lean does not support matching or reachability logic currently. Verifast performs symbollic execution of the verification target like KMIR, however reasoning is performed by annotating functions with design-by-contract components in separation logic.
- **Verification Input:** KMIR takes input from Stable MIR JSON, an effort to serialize the internal MIR in a portable way that can be reusable by other projects.
- **K Ecosystem:** Since all tools in the K ecosystem share a common foundation of K, all projects benefit from development done by other K projects. This means that performance and user experience are projected to improve due to the continued development of other semantics.

## Steps to Use the Tool

At RV, we generally strives to use [kup](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup) , a `nix`-based software installer, to distribute our software.
This is future work, at the moment `kmir` requires a local build from source using the `K Framework` (installed with `kup`).

The future workflow we imagine is to
1. Download [kup](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kup) and install
2. Install KMIR `kup install kmir`
3. Compile the desired verification target with `kmir build module.rs`
   The `module.rs` should contain functions that act as property tests and are run with symbolic inputs.
4. Verify the target with `kmir prove module.rs --target target_function`
   This executes `target_function` with symbolic arguments. The test is expected to contain assertions about computed values.
5. Inspect KCFG of proof with `kmir view module::target_function`

At the time of writing, step 3 requires manual work to set up a _claim_ in the K language.
We will automate this process in the frontend code to prevent the user from having to write K code.

## Versioning
KMIR and Stable MIR JSON are both version controlled using git and hosted by Github. Semantic version numbers are used as soon as releases are made.
Stable MIR JSON depends on a nightly Rust compiler of a particular version (which is regularly updated, currently `nightly-2024-11-29`).
Dependencies for K and MIR JSON are tracked as pinned versions in the 'deps' folder and updated as changes are published upstream and tested against mir-semantics.

## CI
At Runtime Verification, we are regularly releasing and updating our tools using GitHub Actions and publishing our updated tool releases to standardized locations such as [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/runtimeverificationinc) / ghcr.io / [cachix](https://app.cachix.org/cache/k-framework-binary). Any changes upstream to [K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/k) or [stable-mir-json](https://github.com/runtimeverification/stable-mir-json/tree/fbdfe361d79a7d125d4ff70fb7c7b354eee483ee) are immediately propagated to mir-semantics via workflow triggers to ensure the latest release of the tool is getting the latest improvements from K. 

For integrating KMIR into your project's CI pipeline, we recommend using our pre-built packages. You can choose from several installation methods depending on your needs:

Our current Registries / Caches are:
1. [Binary Cachix cache used by Kup](https://app.cachix.org/cache/k-framework-binary)
2. [Source code on GitHub](https://github.com/runtimeverification/mir-semantics)
3. [Container image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/runtimeverificationinc)

A simple Workflow Example using a docker image may look as follows: 
```yaml
name: Test w/ KMIR
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: runtimeverification/mir-semantics:latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Load latest SMIR Json
        run: |
          kmir run
      - name: Create a K Specification
        run: |
          kmir gen-spec
      - name: Prove
        run: |
          kmir prove 
```
